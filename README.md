### HATEOAS
This API is HATEOAS based hypermedia-driven. HATEOAS stands for Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State.The default media type served by Spring HATEOAS is HAL. HAL (Hypertext Application Language) is one of the most popular hypermedia formats to emerge. Itâ€™s lightweight, adding little more to JSON encodings than a _links attribute to contain a list of hyperlinks and their rels.

### Metrics:
Collecting metrics provides the necessary information to handle an API efficiently by giving an insight of how of how it is perfoming, how it is being user and even whether each service is working properly or not.
This API provides data about the number of calls of each HTTP Request along with the corresponding status as well as data about threads, processors, uptime, memory, heap...By calling :

* **/health : basic application health information is provided.**
